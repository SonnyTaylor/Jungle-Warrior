# Jungle Warrior

Jungle Warrior is a simple CLI text adventure game created for a school project. While it may benefit from optimization and code organization, it currently serves its purpose.

## Project Objectives

- Implement a combat system with various attacks and enemies.
- Develop an inventory system that allows players to pick up, drop, and check items.
- Design intricate puzzles with accompanying images.

## Game Modules

The game primarily relies on two modules: Pillow, which is used to display puzzle images, and colorama, an excellent ANSI sequence text colorizer.
