# WIP!

## Dungeon Warrior

A simple CLI text adventure game, created for a school project. it probably could be optimised and fixed like splitting it into multiple files but im lazy and it works

### Project objectives

- Combat system with different attacks and enemys.
- Creating an inventory system with the ability to pickup, drop and check it when needed.
- Intricate puzzles with images

### Game Modules

- The game mainly uses two modules: Pillow (to show an image for a puzzle) and colorama (an amazing ANSI sequence text colorizer).
